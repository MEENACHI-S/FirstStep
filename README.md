# FirstStep
The project involves creating a web application using Python's Flask framework to predict liver cancer.
Users input age and gender through a form, and the app uses a trained machine learning model to provide predictions. The process includes data preprocessing, model training, and developing a user interface with HTML templates.
The app runs locally and addresses ethical and accuracy concerns in medical predictions.
